title: Welcome to Andrew Cai's GitHub blog!

This webpage was created at San Francisco State University in West Grove Commons. Also, this webpage was created on the afternoon of September 14th, 2024.
I created this webpage to create "a site or blog from" my "GitHub repositories with GitHub Pages". I created this webpage by using the webpage at the URL, "https://skills.github.com".

<canvas id="canvas" width="200" height="200"></canvas>

<script>
  var canvas = document.getElementById("canvas");
  var ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");
  ctx.fillRect(0, 0, 10, 10);
</script>
